        <p>
        Isabel's journey started in her childhood, inspired by her mother, a skilled sewist. 
        With sewing tools and fabrics all around her, Isabel quickly fell in love with creating 
        and learned the art of sewing at an early age. Although she aspired to study fashion design,
         life took her in a different direction for a while. However, when her daughter, Carolina,
          was born, the need to stay home and care for her, combined with the global challenges
           of the COVID-19 pandemic, ignited Isabelâ€™s creativity. She began making baby clothes,
            and from that passion, BCocoon Kids was born. Over the years, Isabel has crafted more 
            than 500 unique products, selling them to families worldwide. Today, her store continues to flourish, built on the love, skill, and dedication she has nurtured since childhood, providing parents with beautifully crafted pieces for their little ones.
